Car+ is a 2011/12 Database Systems course project built in over six months by a team of four students from [University of Padua][unipdhomepage].

The project uses Apache + Java + [JDBC][jdbcwiki] + [PostgreSQL][postgresqlwiki]. You can give it a spin [here][carplussite]. 

The project's goal is to develop a [Car Sharing][carsharingwiki] and [Car Pooling][carpoolwiki] platform for a start-up located in [Padua][paduagooglemaps].
